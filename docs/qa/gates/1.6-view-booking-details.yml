    status: "FIXED"
    evidence: "Updated useBooking hook (lines 4-29 of lib/hooks/useBooking.ts) to accept enabled option. refetchInterval function checks options?.enabled. Polling stops when isOpen===false. Performance optimized."

      Added comprehensive test coverage:
      1. components/bookings/__tests__/BookingDetailView.test.tsx - Component tests (loading, error, success, disabled buttons, polling behavior)
      2. app/api/bookings/__tests__/route.test.ts - API integration tests (GET endpoint, auth, 404 handling)
      3. lib/utils/__tests__/date-formatter.test.ts - Utility tests (safeToDate for all input types, Thai formatting)
