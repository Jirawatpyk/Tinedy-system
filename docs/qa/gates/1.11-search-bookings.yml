      action: "Fix Jest/Babel dependency issues and execute all tests"
      rationale: "Verify test coverage works as intended"

    - priority: MEDIUM
      action: "Add basic performance logging (console.time for search operations)"
      rationale: "Establish baseline before production"

  short_term:
    - priority: MEDIUM
      action: "Add E2E test for complete search flow using Playwright"
      rationale: "Validate integration between all components"

    - priority: LOW
      action: "Set up monitoring alert at 100 bookings"
      rationale: "Trigger Algolia migration before performance degrades"

  long_term:
    - priority: LOW
      action: "Implement Algolia as per migration plan"
