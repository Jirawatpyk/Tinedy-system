# Final decision summary

  summary: |
    Story 1.4 demonstrates excellent implementation quality with a score of 85/100.
    All acceptance criteria are met with proper implementation. QA performed minor
    refactoring to improve accessibility and error handling. The lack of automated
    tests is acceptable for this MVP UI story given comprehensive manual testing.

    Recommendations focus on future improvements (Error Boundaries, E2E tests,
    design token extraction) that do not block deployment. Security and performance
    are satisfactory for MVP with clear upgrade path identified.

    The story is approved for merge and deployment.
