story: "1.7"
story_title: "Edit Booking"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All QA fixes verified and implemented excellently. Authentication exists, AC5 change tracking implemented with changeHistory array, immutable fields protected, status transition validation added, comprehensive tests added. Quality improved from 65/100 to 95/100. Ready for production/MVP."

  - id: "SEC-004"
    status: "VERIFIED"
    evidence: "Authentication already present in PATCH endpoint at lines 62-65 of app/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts. Session-based auth with getServerSession() implemented."

  - id: "SEC-005"
    status: "VERIFIED"
    evidence: "Immutable fields protection already present at lines 71-73 of app/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts. Deletes id, createdAt, createdBy before update."

  - id: "DATA-002"
    status: "FIXED"
    evidence: |
      Implemented AC5 change tracking with comprehensive changeHistory array (lines 111-222):
      - Tracks all field changes (customer, service, schedule, notes, status)
      - Compares old vs new values using JSON.stringify for objects
      - Creates changeLogEntry with changedAt, changedBy, and changes array
      - Uses FieldValue.arrayUnion for atomic updates
      - Provides complete audit trail showing who changed what and when

  - id: "LOGIC-004"
    status: "FIXED"
    evidence: |
      Status transition validation added (lines 164-189):
      - Implemented state machine with validTransitions map
      - Validates allowed transitions: pending→confirmed/cancelled, confirmed→in_progress/cancelled, etc.
      - Prevents invalid changes (completed→pending, cancelled→anything)
      - Returns 400 error with details showing current status, requested status, and allowed transitions
      - Proper business rule enforcement

  - id: "TEST-007"
    status: "FIXED"
    evidence: |
      Added comprehensive test coverage in app/api/bookings/__tests__/route.test.ts:
      - PATCH authentication tests (returns 401 if not authenticated)
      - Immutable field protection tests (verifies id/createdAt/createdBy not in update)
      - Change tracking tests (AC5 - verifies changeHistory array populated)
      - Status transition validation tests (LOGIC-004 - tests invalid transitions blocked)
      - All critical PATCH endpoint behaviors covered

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Authentication verified (lines 62-65). Immutable fields protected (lines 71-73). Status validation prevents unauthorized transitions. Excellent security posture."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "React Query optimistic updates implemented. Cache invalidation efficient. Change tracking uses FieldValue.arrayUnion for atomic updates."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive tests verify reliability. Status validation prevents business rule violations. Error handling robust."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code structure. Change tracking pattern reusable for other entities. Clean separation of concerns."

  summary: |
    Outstanding work by DEV team (James). All critical issues resolved with high-quality implementations:
    - SEC-004: Verified auth exists ✅
    - SEC-005: Verified immutable field protection exists ✅
    - DATA-002 (AC5): Comprehensive change tracking implemented ✅
    - LOGIC-004: Status transition validation with state machine ✅
    - TEST-007: Comprehensive PATCH endpoint tests ✅

    Change tracking implementation is particularly well-done with field-level granularity,
    proper atomic updates using FieldValue.arrayUnion, and complete audit trail.
    Status validation prevents business rule violations with clear error messages.
    Code is production-ready with only optional enhancements remaining.
